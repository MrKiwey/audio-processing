In this project,\nyou’ll attempt to create an audio tagging system by extracting audio clip image representations and then\nusing computer vision-based classification models. You can consider constructing your system using a\nrelatively large-scale competition data set and then evaluate it on its ability to recognize and distinguish more specialized sounds on locally generated recordings.\n\n### Goals\n\n1. Investigate and construct models for automatic audio tagging of noisy recordings.\n2. Adapt this to smaller data sets of audio recordings, either by using a setup motivated by your\nabove findings or by transfer learning.\n3. Construct an audio tagging application.\n\n### Methods and materials\n\nTo achieve Goal 1 of the project, you can, for example, use the FSDKaggle2018 used in the Freesound\nGeneral-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge on Kaggle. There are 41 categories of audio clips, and the\ngoal is to classify each clip. For the second objective, you can look for a data set on your own or\nconstruct one yourself.\n\nAs part of the project, you should investigate ways to do data augmentation for audio.\nYou’ll make use of a variety of Python audio libraries, e.g., librosa. You should also look into fastxtend, a library built on top of fastai. To construct the application, you’re free to use any solution you know or want to investigate. A natural starting point is the deployment solutions used in the fastai course.\n\nConsider not converting audio to images but instead setting up an audio classification framework that\noperates on audio representations of the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
